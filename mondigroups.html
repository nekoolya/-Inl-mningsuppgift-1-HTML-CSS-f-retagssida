    <h1> What we do</h1>
	
    <p>We sustainably manage forests and purchase wood from responsible sources to produce pulp. Along with paper for recycling, we then turn the pulp into containerboard, kraft paper and uncoated fine paper.</p>
	<p> Our converting operations require paper and other raw materials such as resins, films and nonwovens (some of which we produce ourselves) to create a wide range of innovative and sustainable packaging solutions and advanced materials that contribute to our customers' success.    </p> 
	<p> We are fully integrated across the packaging and paper value chain â€“ from managing forests and producing pulp, paper and compound plastics to developing industrial and consumer packaging solutions. </p>

    <h2> Our competitive advantages </h2>
    <p> Superior returns on capital employed thanks to our disciplined approach to, and implementation of investment decisions.
	Inherent and sustainable cost advantages because of our high-quality, low-cost production base; footprint in emerging markets; and focus on driving performance. Our passion for performance will always be central to the way we run our business and is demonstrated through a continuous focus on quality, productivity and efficiency.
	We have systems and processes in place to benchmark against our best performing operations, share lessons learnt, identify emerging issues, optimise productivity, minimise waste and deliver quality products to our customers on time. </p>
	
	<h2> Invest in assets with cost advantage </h2>
	<p> Investing in assets with a cost advantage to maintain and enhance our competitive advantages plays an important role in delivering our industry leading returns. This is of particular importance in our pulp and paper assets, where products are generally more commoditised and low-cost production is key. </p>
	
	<h2> Inspire our people and grow responsibly </h2>
	<p> Our long-term success is dependent on our ability to integrate sustainability across the Group. This ensures that we can continue to address the risks and opportunities that arise from global environmental and societal trends, retain our competitive edge and generate value for our stakeholders.
	 We believe that being part of the solution to global challenges will secure the long-term success of our business and the wellbeing of our communities and other stakeholders. </p>
